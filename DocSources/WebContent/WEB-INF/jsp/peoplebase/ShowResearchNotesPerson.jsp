		<li>Cosimo was the son of Giovanni di Averardo (Bicci) and Piccarda Bueri. His wife gave him two sons, Piero il Gottoso and Giovanni. A third son, Carlo, was born out of wedlock. He was educated by Nicolao di Pietro and Roberto de' Rossi. Cosimo's brilliant investment of the funds accumulated by his father Giovanni and his administration of the Medici banks made him one of the wealthiest men in Europe. In 1415 Cosimo accompanied Johannes XXIII to the Council of Konstanz. The same year he was named Priore and shortly afterwards began to used by the Republic as an Ambassador. His wealth and growing political power created enemies and in 1433 he was exiled by the rival Florentine faction guided by Rinaldo degli Albizzi. He took refuge in Venice where he endowed the Benedictine monastery of San Giorgio with a collection of books and codices and had Michelozzo draw plans for a library. In 1434, he managed to return to Florence and to have his rivals exiled. From that date he was the de facto ruler of the city state, even though he left most of the Republican structures of the government intact. In 1438 he convinced the Ecumenical Council to meet in Florence. He was a patron of Humanistic scholars and the founder in 1444 of the first public library. He had Michelozzo build the Medici palace in Via Larga now known as the Medici-Riccardi palace and continued the restoration of the church of San Lorenzo started by his father. He funded the construction and restoration of several monasteries including San Marco in Florence. He also had Michelozzo restructure and Vincenzo Foppa decorate the Medici palace in Milan. He was buried in the crypt under the main altar of the church of San Lorenzo.</li>
