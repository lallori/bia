	 *  value for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described
	 *  in the Java(TM) Object Serialization Specification. However, it is 
	 *  strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare 
	 *  serialVersionUID values, since the default serialVersionUID computation 
	 *  is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler
	 *  implementations, and can thus result in unexpected 
	 *  InvalidClassExceptions during deserialization. Therefore, to guarantee a
	 *   consistent serialVersionUID value across different java compiler 
	 *   implementations, a serializable class must declare an explicit 
	 *  serialVersionUID value. It is also strongly advised that explicit 
	 *  serialVersionUID declarations use the private modifier where possible, 
	 *  since such declarations apply only to the immediately declaring 
	 *  class--serialVersionUID fields are not useful as inherited members.
